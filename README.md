# Bistro Restaurant App

Welcome to the Bistro Restaurant App! This application allows users to view the menu, make a reservation and submit orders, which will be sent to the server for processing. The orders and booking information are stored in a bookings.json file.


After cloning the repository, install the required packages.
```bash
npm install

```

## Start the Frontend Application
```bash
npm run dev

```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

## Start the Backend Server

In a separate terminal, run the below.

```bash
npm start

```

## Viewing the Data
The data from the bookings page and the user orders will be stored in the booking.json file. 

To view and read the data more easily, you can use a JSON prettier tool, such as JSON Pretty Print. Simply copy and paste the contents of the booking.json file into the tool to display the data in a more readable format.


### Happy ordering!
